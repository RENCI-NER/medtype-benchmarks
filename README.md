# MedType Benchmarks

In October 2021, the RENCI Named Entity Recognition (NER) Working Group was established to
compare different NER tools and techniques. This repository was created to benchmark
[MedType](https://github.com/svjan5/medtype), an open-source NER tool described in
[a 2005 arXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00460).
